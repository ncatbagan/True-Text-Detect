# MQ PACE S2 2024 - AI Text Detector 
<h2>Group 51</h2>
<p>This project addresses the emerging challenges posed by advancements in AI-generated content. While AI technology holds significant potential for positive applications, it also poses risks by generating high-quality, deceptive content that is difficult to distinguish from human-produced material. Malicious actors can exploit these capabilities to create false, credible-sounding content and profiles at scale. This project focuses on solving the core challenge of accurately detecting machine-generated content. Specifically, developing robust techniques to identify AI-generated content, and ensuring the detection of erroneous, hallucinating, or misleading information.</p>
